# Train-Schedule
### PennLPS Bootcamp Week #7 Assignment

Users can check the expected time of arrival for their train and the frequency in which their train arrives. If their train is not listed, the user can input information to have their train added to the schedule. 

The train scheduler stores data in Firebase for data persistence and retreives information from the database on load. Schedules are refreshed reflect dynamic arrival and departure times by using Moment.js
